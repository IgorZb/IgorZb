Hi, I´m Igor. Working as seaman onboard petroleum tankers
I’m interested in popular science, learning and Unreal Engine.
I’m currently learning Unreal Engine.
I’m looking to collaborate on my project of a full-scale simulator of merchant ships. Looking for UE developers with experience in Lyra.
Feel free to contact me via ambitiousteam.easyship@gmail.com
